# React-App-
React App that works with various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that talk to different data source . We're using the OpenWeather API to get weather data on different cities. At the moment, it displays basic information about a location when you type it in. Check out Issues for some more ideas! we need our own API Key from their website (for free) and add it as an environment variable in a .env file. We have a template available as example.env. we'll be using React initially to build this.
